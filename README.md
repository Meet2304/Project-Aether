<h1 align="center">Project Aether</h1>

<p align = 'justify'>
In ancient myth, Aether was the divine light — the purest form of air that filled the heavens, untouched by clouds, bias, or darkness. It was the breath of gods, a realm of absolute clarity where all things were seen as they truly were.
<br>
Inspired by that same spirit, Project Aether is built to bring clarity, fairness, and objectivity to performance evaluation. Powered by computer vision, it observes without emotion, judges without bias, and sees every motion with precision and truth.
<br>
Where human error clouds judgment, Aether remains clear.
Where opinions falter, Aether stands firm.
In a world full of noise, Aether listens only to the movement — and tells the truth in every frame.
<br>
This is more than a system.
It is a promise — to let performance speak for itself.
